                <p style={{textAlign: "justify"}}>In October 2nd, 2005 I heard a still small voice from God about God’s Glory Restoration prophetic Ministry and I didn’t understand the Meaning of the Ministry’s name until God told me to leave my profession ( Building Engineering)and be a full time Minister after I have spent 20years in Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministry.</p>
                <p style={{textAlign: "justify"}}> In Year 2010 I went with my family to meet my spiritual father ( Pastor Lawrence Olaseinde ) and he told me that my revelation is real but I need to exercise Patience and confirm the voice he told me that when God calls man there is time, there is location and mission or assignment and he advised me to start my assignment as a full time Minister in MFM for God to confirm His will in my life which I accepted. To confirm the name of the ministry and to have the deeper meaning of the name of my Ministry whenever I pray for anyone the voices used to speak through them and always say he had stolen their Glory . The voice can be the voice of family familiar spirit, spirit of the powers of their father’s house, or territorial powers. There always manifestation and the devils confessed he had stolen their Glory and he is ready to return their Glory after hot prayers. This voices from the people I pray for confirmed the name of my Ministry that God gave in 2005 which I didn’t understand at that time.</p>

        <div className='col-12 col-md-6'>
          
          <p style={{textAlign: "justify"}}>After one and half years of being a full time Minister my spiritual father was transferred to port Harcourt for higher assignments for God and another Senior Regional overseers posted to MFM utako ( Pastor Peters Adedeji) in Year 2012. I continued with God given assignments at senior Regional overseers office for another 5years before God told me to resign and start my Ministry. God revealed to me in my dream I saw Dr. D.k Olukoya only him drawing water from the well and the water was so pure and asked him that I wanted to help him to draw the water from the well, he look at me and gave me the drawer which he was using to fetch the water from the well and he instructed me to see him on Wednesday. There are lot of Revelation before I finally yielded to God’s call. There was a day God told me when I felt reluctant to start the Ministry and said Matthew! Matthew! Matthew! In an exclamation tone that If I am still believe in him and I told him where did he want me to start? after I have spent about 21years in MFM and God said I should start from anywhere and He had positioned men and women on my way to assist me in my Ministry. </p>
